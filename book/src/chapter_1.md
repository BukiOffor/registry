### Chapter 1: **Introduction**

**Building a CIS5 Wallet Registry Smart Contract on Concordium**

In the fast-paced world of blockchain, smart contracts are becoming the cornerstone of decentralized systems, enabling secure, automated transactions without intermediaries. However, as decentralized applications (dApps) proliferate, there arises a critical need for standards that simplify user interactions, especially in wallet management.

In this book, we will explore a practical solution to a common problem: the unreadability and inflexibility of ed25519 public keys on chaperone accounts. Weâ€™ll achieve this by building a smart contract that registers user-friendly tags for wallets, making it easier to interact with blockchain-based wallets while maintaining security. This smart contract mimics the CIS5 wallet standard and is deployed on Concordium, a blockchain platform known for its strong focus on privacy and regulatory compliance.

**The Problem: Public Key Readability and Usability**

Public keys, such as those used in blockchain wallets, are long, complex strings of characters. While they are crucial for ensuring secure asset management, they are far from user-friendly. Typing or sharing these keys introduces the risk of human error, which can lead to lost assets or failed transactions.

Consider the `PublicKeyEd25519` used in Concordium's smart contracts wallet. This key, while highly secure, is not meant for human interaction. Users are required to copy and paste these keys or store them securely, and any mistake in this process can lead to catastrophic results. Furthermore, if users want to interact with different smart contracts, they have no easy way of associating their public key with a specific wallet or application.

**The CIS5 Wallet Registry**

The CIS5 wallet registry addresses some of these concerns by defining a more user-friendly way to manage wallets. The standard is designed to facilitate the use of blockchain wallets for managing both native and token assets on Concordium.

In this book, we will extend the utility of CIS5 wallets by creating a registry that maps these cryptographic keys to human-readable tags. Users will be able to register a tag, such as `alice.ccd`, which can then be used for subsequent interactions on the blockchain. This allows for simpler, more intuitive wallet management.

**The Goal of This Book**

By the end of this book, you will understand how to build and deploy a smart contract on Concordium that:
- Maps human-readable tags to cryptographic public keys.
- Allows for reverse lookups, where a public key can return its associated tag.
- Ensures that each key can only have one tag for its lifetime.
- Exposes simple and secure interfaces for registering, retrieving, and managing these wallet tags.

Whether you are a seasoned blockchain developer or just starting out, this book will provide you with the knowledge and tools needed to create your own smart contract solutions, while offering insights into the practical use cases of the CIS5 wallet standard.
