### Chapter 6: **Security Considerations (Revised)**

When dealing with a smart contract registry that stores sensitive information like public keys and wallet addresses, security is paramount. In this chapter, we will discuss the built-in security mechanisms of the CIS5 wallet registry, including signature verification and error handling. These features ensure that only authorized parties can interact with the registry, and that the data integrity is maintained throughout the lifecycle of the contract.

#### 6.1 Signature Verification

The contract relies heavily on **signature verification** to ensure that actions like registering a wallet tag or retrieving sensitive information can only be performed by authorized entities. In the registry, **Ed25519 signatures** are used to secure messages and prove ownership of the corresponding public keys.

##### 6.1.1 Validating Signatures

The key function responsible for validating signatures in this contract is `validate_signature`. This function checks that the message was indeed signed by the owner of the provided public key and that the signature has not expired.

Here’s the relevant code:

```rust
fn validate_signature<T: Serial + IsMessage>(
    message: &T,
    signer: PublicKeyEd25519,
    signature: SignatureEd25519,
    crypto_primitives: &impl HasCryptoPrimitives,
    ctx: &ReceiveContext,
) -> RegistryResult<()> {
    // Check that the signature is not expired.
    ensure!(
        message.expiry_time() > ctx.metadata().slot_time(),
        Error::Expired
    );

    // Calculate the message hash.
    let message_hash: [u8; 32] =
        calculate_message_hash_from_bytes(&to_bytes(&message), crypto_primitives, ctx)?;

    // Check the signature.
    let valid_signature =
        crypto_primitives.verify_ed25519_signature(signer, signature, &message_hash);
    ensure!(valid_signature, Error::WrongSignature);

    Ok(())
}
```

##### 6.1.2 Steps in Signature Verification

1. **Message Expiry**:
   - First, the function checks whether the message has expired. This is critical to prevent replay attacks, where an old message is resent to the contract in an attempt to manipulate the state. If the message’s expiry time has passed, the contract returns the `Error::Expired` error.

2. **Message Hash Calculation**:
   - The contract then calculates the hash of the message. This hash is used to verify the signature and ensure that the message has not been tampered with.

3. **Signature Validation**:
   - Finally, the contract checks the validity of the signature using the `verify_ed25519_signature` function. If the signature does not match the signer’s public key, the contract returns the `Error::WrongSignature` error.

By following this process, the contract ensures that only authorized users (i.e., those with valid signatures) can interact with it.

##### 6.1.3 Why Ed25519?

The **Ed25519** signature scheme is chosen for its strong security properties, including resistance to attacks on elliptic curve cryptography and speed in verifying signatures. It is widely used in blockchain applications due to these strengths and its compact key sizes.

#### 6.2 Error Handling for Security

The contract includes several error handling mechanisms that ensure it operates securely and reliably. These error messages are returned when certain security checks fail, allowing users and wallet providers to understand what went wrong and take corrective action.

##### 6.2.1 Key Errors and Their Purpose

1. **`Error::Expired`**:
   - This error is triggered when a message is submitted after its expiry time. It prevents old messages from being replayed and ensures that only recent, valid transactions are processed.

2. **`Error::WrongSignature`**:
   - If the signature verification fails (i.e., the signature does not match the public key), the contract returns this error. This prevents unauthorized users from submitting messages on behalf of others.

3. **`Error::TagAlreadyExists`**:
   - This error occurs when a user tries to register a tag that already exists in the contract. It ensures the uniqueness of tags and prevents key duplication.

4. **`Error::KeyDoesNotExist`** and **`Error::TagDoesNotExist`**:
   - These errors are returned when a user tries to look up a key or tag that is not registered in the contract. This prevents unauthorized or erroneous access to the contract’s state.

#### 6.3 Additional Security Considerations

While signature verification is one of the most critical aspects of security in this contract, other practices help ensure the contract’s overall security and integrity:

1. **No Mutable External Calls**:
   - The contract does not make any external calls during state changes that could modify the state of other contracts. This limits its attack surface and reduces the risk of reentrancy attacks.

2. **Limited Entry Points**:
   - The contract exposes only three core entry points (`register`, `get_key`, and `get_tag`). By keeping the interface minimal, the contract limits the potential for security vulnerabilities and reduces the complexity of interactions.

3. **Testing and Auditing**:
   - Rigorous testing of the contract’s functionality and security features is essential before deployment. Audits by independent security experts can help identify any potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the contract’s design.

### Chapter Summary

In this chapter, we explored the key security features of the CIS5 wallet registry contract:

- **Signature Verification** ensures that only authorized users can interact with the contract.
- **Error Handling** provides clear feedback when security checks fail, allowing users to understand and resolve issues.
- **Additional Security Practices** like limiting entry points and avoiding mutable external calls further enhance the contract’s robustness.

Together, these mechanisms provide a secure and reliable foundation for the CIS5 wallet registry, protecting users and their assets from unauthorized access and manipulation.

In the next chapter, **Chapter 7: Deployment and Usage**, we’ll guide you through deploying the contract on the Concordium network and demonstrate how to interact with it in a live environment.
